# Artificial_Intelligence_Practical_Projects
Practical problems of AI course offered by prof. M. Soleymani at CE Dept. at Sharif University of Technology.

A* Search: Solving the Loopover Puzzle https://loopover.xyz/. Finging a solution for the puzzle using A* Search algorithm in less than 10s, given initial state of the puzzle as the input. Due to extremely large search space, alongside choosing appropriate heuristic function, a divide and conquer approach has been used to reach the answer as soon as possible.

Local Search and CSP: Implementing CSP for the given problem, Solving Traveling Salesman Problem using local search algorithm such as Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Search, and implementing Gradient Descent algoritm.

Adversarial Search: Using Adversarial Search algorithm for playing the given boardgame.

MDP: Solving a Marcov Decision Process for calculating the optimal policy in a quiz show.

Reinforcement Learning: Implementing RL to derive the best policy to reach the goal in FrozenLake problem https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/.
